# TODO for Calculator Fix

- [x] Modify inputOperation function in Calculator.js to handle '=' operation correctly:
  - When nextOperation is '=', calculate the result using previousValue, current display, and operation.
  - Set display to the calculated result.
  - Set previousValue to the result.
  - Set operation to null.
  - Do not reset display to '0'.
- [x] Remove the '=' case from calculate function as it's not needed.
- [x] Test the calculator to ensure calculations work correctly (e.g., 56 + 25 = 81).
